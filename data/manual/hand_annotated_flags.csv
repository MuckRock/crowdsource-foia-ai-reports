The model was trained on human review decisions to identify cable features that are typically indicative of information that is released and that which is exempt from release. The results were reviews that were 97%-99% in agreement with the human reviews. In 2023, the Department plans to leverage this model to complete the 25- year review of cables from 1998.

With the announcement of the decommissioning of FOIAOnline in 2021, the FOIA Officer and Deputy Branch Chief, along with staff from OCIO, invested significant time and effort to research alternate FOIA processing systems. In March 2023, the Agency posted a public solicitation for quotes, and the FOIA Officer, Deputy Branch Chief, and OCIO staff reviewed the submissions. SecureRelease, a product of Deloitte, was chosen.

On March 8, 2023, EPA selected the winning quote for a FOIA case management system to replace FOIAonline and entered into a contract with OPEXUS to provide FOIAXpress. Throughout the remainder of FY2023 and into FY2024, EPA has worked with OPEXUS to use FOIAXpress to its fullest and to identify ways that the FOIAXpress system can be improved to better meet FOIA implementation demands.
